        <p><strong><em>About Me</em></strong></p>
        I decided to do programming because, as a maturing discipline, technology is advancing and software is becoming more and more important in our everyday lives. Programmers create infrastructure and applications which are beyond imagination.I want to believe and create unimaginable things too. I want to be surrounded by dreamers and creatives.
        <br> I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set, as I continue to learn new languages and development techniques.</br>
